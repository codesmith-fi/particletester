Delta Engine port of SmithNgine Particle System 
------------------------------------------------

This is my submission for Delta Engine April 2013 contest.

This is a Delta Engine version of the particle system ported from SmithNgine which is a XNA
based game framework. See more @ http://blog.codesmith.fi

This particle system is pretty robust and extendable. Effects and emitters can be layered as much as you want. There are multiple ready made generators and modifiers which affect how particles are generated. 

Codebase is exactly same in both versions, except DE version uses Renderer and DE Sprite instead of Texture2D which is used in XNA version of SmithNgine particle system. Framerate is bit slower in this DE version but that probably caused by my incompetence with Delta Engine, still learning :)
